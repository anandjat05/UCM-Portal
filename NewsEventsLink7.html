			<p>Contact: Jeff Murphy</br>
			WARRENSBURG, MO (Feb. 27, 2018) – The University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg and UCM-Lee’s Summit will participate in a statewide tornado drill at 10 a.m. Tuesday, March 6. This drill is expected to last about 15 minutes, and is designed to orient faculty, staff and students in appropriate measures to take during a real tornadic event.  </br>

			To help prepare the campus community prior to the drill, the UCM Department of Public Safety/Environmental Health and Safety is encouraging faculty members and supervisors to share information about the drill with students and colleagues. UCM realizes that conducting such a drill may be disruptive to everyone’s daily schedule, but the institution’s responsibility to protect our campus community cannot be over emphasized.  UCM will attempt to keep all disruption to a minimum.</br> 

			UCM’s participation in the drill is part of a statewide effort. Should the state experience severe weather on the day of the drill, the event will be postponed until March 8.    </br>

			During the event, the Warrensburg campus will be notified by the UCM outdoor warning system, building public address, and through TextCaster text message alerts.  Anyone who has not signed up for this free service is encouraged to visit ucmo.edu/ps/ to learn more and sign up for the service. Individuals who have changed their mobile telephone provider since signing up for TextCaster is encouraged to sign up again to ensure they receive alerts. </br> 

			Members of the UCM-Lee’s Summit campus ares encouraged to participate and will be notified by Lee’s Summit outdoor warning devices, as well as through the Nixel Alerting Service.  Lee’s Summit staff, faculty and students are encouraged to sign up for the Lee’s Summit Nixel service at  Have you tried Nixle yet? > City of Lee's Summit > City of Lee's Summit | Lee's Summit, MO.</br>

			During the drill, participants should immediately go to an indoor shelter and proceed to the lowest floor of the building, preferably an interior room or hallway, away from glass. Designated shelter areas on the Warrensburg campus are identified on building emergency plans by this symbol.  Individuals should remain in the shelter area until the drill is concluded.</br>
