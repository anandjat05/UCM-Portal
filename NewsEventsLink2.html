			WARRENSBURG, MO (March 16, 2018) – Beginning his work at the University of Central Missouri in fall 2016, Matthew J. Garver’s tenure may be brief, but the positive impact he is having on students has contributed to his selection as recipient of the Missouri Governor’s Award for Excellence in Education.</br>

			Garver, who serves as an assistant professor in the Department of Nutrition and Kinesiology and program coordinator for Exercise Science, was honored publicly by the university’s Board of Governors when it met on campus March 16. He will be honored with other outstanding educators from across the state during an April 5 luncheon at Scruggs University Center at Lincoln University in Jefferson City.</br>

			The annual awards program is made possible by the Missouri Council on Public Higher Education (COPHE). Thirteen public universities select Governor’s Award for Excellence in Education recipients on the basis of criteria that include effective teaching at the undergraduate level, effective advising of undergraduate students, service to the college community, and commitment to high standards of excellence. Other qualities include success in nurturing student achievement and the impact nominees have had on the academic and personal lives of their students.</br>

			The UCM award selection committee ranked individuals nominated for the award, based on the breadth of scholarship, teaching and service. They also considered the nominee’s narrative, student feedback and letters of support.</br>

			In announcing its selection, the committee noted that Garver’s “work in all areas of teaching service and scholarship are far beyond what is required of an assistant professor.” It pointed out he has made lasting impressions on his students, and goes above and beyond to prepare and mentor his students for success both inside and outside the classroom.</br>

			In his personal narrative, Garver notes that nurturing student achievement ties into his overarching goals to make a difference. It directly connects to his teaching and scholarly endeavors.</br>

			When my students meet success, I count the victory as well. When my time is done, I hope to have extensions into the lives of many others. I hope they are better for having known me,” he noted.</br>

			Garver has spent the past eight years in higher education.  Prior to coming to UCM, he served for a year at The Ohio State University, where he was a senior lecturer and also earned his Ph.D. in exercise physiology. He also worked for five years as an assistant professor at Abilene Christian University. He earned teaching awards at both schools.</br>

			At UCM, his teaching assignments are in Exercise Science and Exercise Metabolism and Physiology. In addition to teaching, he has served as a faculty research mentor for the Ronald E. McNair Scholars Program, working with students who are underrepresented in higher education by helping them to prepare to become graduate students. A student he mentored went on to become the 2017 student recipient of the Learning to a Greater Degree Award.</br>

			In a letter of support for Garver, Margaret Shull, director of the McNair Scholars Program, stated that he is someone who views every student as unique, and tries to develop both their strengths and weaknesses.He genuinely cares about the success of his students while holding them to high standards,” she said.</br>

			Garver looks for opportunities to bring innovation into his classroom. For example, he has sought assistance from the Center for Teaching and Learning to provide a more effective delivery of his online graduate course on exercise metabolism. He invested in online lectures through the purchase of Adobe Connect and has aspirations to utilize the CTL technology Lightboard Studio to enhance the course.</br>

			He has conducted his own scholarly research and is recognized on 14 manuscripts and more than 45 published abstracts during the last decade, in addition to serving as a conference presenter. Garver intentionally brings students into his work, and his collaboration with students has included topic areas such as sports medicine. He serves as a reviewer for journals in rheumatology and sports sciences and is active in the Regional American College of Sports Medicine chapter.</br>

			Garver commented on the award noting, “As much as any factor, this selection likely reflects that I have had supporters grounding me and mentors guiding me. I am grateful for that fact. Certainly, I am humbled and honored by this recognition. My passion is to make a difference in the lives of students’ positions well within the fit and feel of the UCM community. I am proud to be a Mule.”</br>

			He added, “The close connection with students, an intentional and purposed goal for UCM, provides great alignment with my desires as a teacher and mentor. I feel comfort in the classroom and I constantly learn from my class cohorts. I would be remiss if I did not thank my departmental faculty and directly my program colleagues who make my day enjoyable. To my past students, I am grateful for the time that we have invested together and the bonds that we have formed. To my future students, I am excited to meet you and I hope we enjoy the journey together.”</br>
